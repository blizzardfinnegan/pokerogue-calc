# DNA Splice and Fusion
base stats averaged independently
Base stats != summary stats
held items transfer, movesets transfer
type is 1st from primary and 2nd from sacrifice (unless same)
keeps primary passive, sacrifice main
keep primary current level, iv, nature
luck is sum of luck
fused parts can individually evolve
shedinja as 2nd, cap of 1hp
form-change abilities are null with fused

use scarecrow-g59 pokerogue-fusion for fusion gen?
